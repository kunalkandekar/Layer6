License: Undecided as yet, but I'm leaning towards more permissive licenses like
BSD, MIT or Apache. I'd like to choose a license which has the fewest incompati-
bilities with other licensess like the GPL, or maybe multi-license it. Further, 
I would like the specification to be more restrictively licensed to enforce 
interoperability between any other implementations of the spec. However, I am 
not sure if it's sensible, advisable or even possible to license the spec under
a different license than the code, and what that would mean. 

Basically, at this time I am not informed enough to make the right choice. 

In the meantime, if you wish to use this code for experimentation, feel free to
do so, with the understanding that I hold no liabilities. If you wish to use the
code for any other reason, feel free to contact me at: kunalkandekar@gmail.com. 
Maybe you could help me reach a good decision!
